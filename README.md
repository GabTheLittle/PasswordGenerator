As a beginner, I quickly started to search up for small project to code and ended up with the idea of a password generator.
The program is quite simple : it generates a password out of lowercase and capitals letters, numbers and special characters.

If you have suggestion or idea to improve this program, please tell me in the ðŸ’¡Ideas discussion channel without giving me any piece of code ! (it will force me to think by myself and to lead my own researches)

Thanks in advance for you help ! :)
